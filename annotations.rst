Some annotations about project findings


* http://www.charvolant.org/~doug/xkb/html/node5.html at section **Key
  codes** offer a key code mapping that could be useful for naming in
  a somewhat standard way the keys in this project.

  See also /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/latin to check real mapping
  (e.g. charvolant doesn't include <LSGT> key code.

  teclat.odg contains a code name map for 105 keys
